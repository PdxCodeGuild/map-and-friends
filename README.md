# map and friends

This workshop will guide you towards understanding how to use the map, filter, and reduce array methods.

This is a test-driven workshop, meaning you can run tests to verify if your solution is correct!

Note: you will need `node` and `npm` installed in order to run the tests.

To setup the project, clone this repo locally, and then in the root directory of the project, run:

```
npm install
```

That will install the needed dependencies.

Then to run tests, run:

```
npm test
```

At first all the tests should be failing. You will have to open up `workshop.js` and fill in the missing functions to make the tests pass.

Read all the comments carefully!

Good luck!

P.S. Let me know if there are typos or misleading comments, etc. Thanks!
